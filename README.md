# Jets Application
The Jets application allows a user to interact with a set of aircraft in the Airfield. The users have a wide range of options to interact with the airfield which include adding and removing jets from the application.
### Description of the project
The user will be presented with 5 pre-determined jets in the airfield. The user can then enter which actions they would like to take from the following menu:
1. List fleet
2. Fly all jets
3. View fastest jet
4. View jet with longest range
5. Load all Cargo Jets
6. Dogfight!
7. Add a jet to Fleet
8. Remove a jet from Fleet
9. Quit

### Technologies used
Abstract classes
Deploy separate objects to represent variations of the abstract jet class.
Conditionals
Interface implementation.
### Issues encountered
Many compilation issues :). The application currently has an issue closing. when attempting to exit the program, it closes hard. Was the next thing to fix on the list.
